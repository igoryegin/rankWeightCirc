\title{
Mean circular direction for rank-weighted data
}
\description{
This function calculates the average direction for angular data with rank weights, i.e. weights that take integer values from 1 to N (N = sample size)
}
\usage{
meancirc.weighted(theta, w)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{theta}{
a vector of angular observations or an object of class \emph{circular}
}
  \item{w}{
a numeric vector of weights; these are automatically converted into ranks
}
}
\details{
Weighted angular mean is formally defined as \eqn{\mu^{(w)}=\text{atan2}({b_1^{(w)}, a_1^{(w)}})}, where \eqn{\text{atan2}} is the two-valued arctangent function which returns the angle between a circular observation and the x-axis.
}
\value{
Returns the weighted mean direction of the data
