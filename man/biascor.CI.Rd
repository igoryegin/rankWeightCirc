\title{
Bias-Corrected Confidence Intervals For Some Rank-Weighted Summary Statistics
}
\description{
Normally, the point estimates of mean direction and mean resultant length are biased.
The bias term increases substantially if the population counterpart is
close to zero (i.e., if the angles are scattered around the circle quasi-uniformly), so failure to account for the bias may lead to inaccure confidence interval bands.

This function computes a confidence interval for either rank-weighted mean direction or rank-weighted mean resultant length while removing the bias term at the same time.
}
\usage{
biascor.CI(stat = c("mu", "rho"), theta, w, CI.level)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{stat}{
Summary statistic for which a CI is produced.
Can be either rank-weighted mean angular direction ("mu") or rank-weighted mean resultant vector length ("rho").
Other values are not allowed and will result in an error.
}
  \item{theta}{
a vector of angular observations or an object of class \emph{circular}
}
  \item{w}{
a numeric vector of weights; these are automatically converted into ranks
}
  \item{CI.level}{
confidence level; a number between 0 and 1
}
